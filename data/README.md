## Data

### We use the public `Credit Card Fraud Detection` dataset (European card transactions, anonymized features) available at: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) (subject to Kaggle terms of use)

### After downloading the dataset (for example, creditcard.csv), place the credit card transaction dataset file (e.g. `creditcard.csv`) inside the data/ directory:

data/
├─ creditcard.csv
└─ README.md

## Dataset Instructions

**Full dataset**: Download `creditcard.csv` from [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and place it here.

**Sample data**: Use `sample_creditcard.csv` (included) for testing the notebook without downloading the full dataset.

### If necessary, update any hard-coded paths in the notebook to match your local setup.
### If you cannot access the full dataset, you may construct a small synthetic subset to test that the notebook runs, but note that this will not reproduce the paper results.
