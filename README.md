# C-STEN-CCFD: Contrastive Spatio‑Temporal Deep Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository provides a **self-contained Jupyter Notebook** implementation of a Contrastive Spatio‑Temporal deep learning pipeline (C‑STEN) for **credit card fraud detection and evaluation** using the public Kaggle `creditcard.csv` dataset. [file:45]

The main artifact is: `notebooks/c-sten-ccfd.ipynb` (end‑to‑end: data → training → evaluation). [file:45]
