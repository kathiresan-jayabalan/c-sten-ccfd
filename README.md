# Data

## We use the public `Credit Card Fraud Detection` dataset (European card transactions, anonymized features) available at: `https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud` (subject to Kaggle terms of use)

## After downloading the dataset (for example, creditcard.csv), place the credit card transaction dataset file (e.g. `creditcard.csv`) inside the data/ directory:

data/
├─ creditcard.csv
└─ README.md

## If necessary, update any hard-coded paths in the notebook to match your local setup.

### If you cannot access the full dataset, you may construct a small synthetic subset to test that the notebook runs, but note that this will not reproduce the paper results.
